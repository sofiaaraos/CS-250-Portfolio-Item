#### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpreted user needs through the use of user stories since user stories draw directly from how the user expects a feature to work. User Stories help with this because they contain helpful information in the form of a "story" so that developers can implement the feature.

#### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I used to approach development without a clear plan but now try to use agile. I hope to incorporate Scrum-agile and Kanban into my future development as I've found it to be extremely helpful in keeping everything concise.

#### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member fulfills their role, communicates with the rest of the team, and contributes to the program. If a team member fails at one of these, then the entire team or program could suffer.
